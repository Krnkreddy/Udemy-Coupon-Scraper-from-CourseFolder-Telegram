📌 How to Export Your Udemy Login Cookies (For Automation)
----------------------------------------------

1. ✅ Install a browser extension to export cookies:
   - For Chrome: "Get cookies.txt" (by www.getcookie.org)
   - For Firefox: "Cookies.txt" extension

2. 🔐 Log in to your Udemy account in your browser.

3. 🌐 Go to https://www.udemy.com

4. 🍪 Click the extension icon and export cookies as JSON or cookies.txt.
   - Save the file as: `udemy_auth.json`

5. 📁 Place the `udemy_auth.json` file in the same folder as your Python script.

6. 🚀 Run the script. Your session will be reused to enroll in courses without re-logging in.

----------------------------------------------
⚠️ Do NOT share your `udemy_auth.json` file. It contains your login session and can be misused.
